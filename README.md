# CKA-framework
This repository is an official implementation of the paper "Joint lesion detection and classification of breast 
ultrasound video via a clinical knowledge-aware framework". (The complete code will be added after the manuscript is published.)

## Dataset
We collect and annotate an ultrasound video
dataset (298 videos) for lesion detection and classification in ultrasound videos, including 170 benign cases and 128 
malignant cases.

## Code Usage

## Installation

### Requirements

* Linux, CUDA>=11.3, GCC>=7.5.0
  
* Python>=3.8

* PyTorch>=1.11.0, torchvision>=0.12.0 (following instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/))

* Other requirements
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  
### Dataset preparation

Please organize the dataset as following:

```
code_root/
└── buv/
      ├── rawframes/
      ├── train.json
      └── val.json
```

### Training

For example, the command for training CKA-framework is as following:

```bash
python main.py
```
The configs in main.py can be changed.

### Evaluation

After obtaining the trained CKA-framework, then run following command to evaluate it on the validation set:

```bash
python validation.py
```
